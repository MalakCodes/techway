# Tech Way Project
Tech Way is a personal project I developed during my web development learning journey.

This project was created with two main goals:
	1.	To benefit beginners in the tech field and help them discover their career path.
	2.	To help me grow personally by applying what I’ve learned into a useful product.

Technologies Used:
	•	HTML
	•	CSS
	•	JavaScript

This is only the first version of the project.

There will be future improvements, advanced technologies, and backend development added to this website.
